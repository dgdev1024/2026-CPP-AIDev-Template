# Specification: Folder Structure

Below is the specification for the folder structure used by this workspace.

## Root Folder Structure

```
root/
├── build/              # Build output and artifacts (e.g., binaries, object files, etc.)
├── ├── bin/            # Compiled binaries and executables
├── ├── obj/            # Object files and intermediate build artifacts
├── ├── ...             # Other build-related folders (e.g., logs/, coverage/, etc.)
├── docs/               # Specifications and documentation
├── templates/          # Document templates
├── projects/           # C and C++ projects
├── vendor/             # Third-party libraries and dependencies
├── scripts/            # Build and utility scripts
├── tools/              # Development tools and utilities
├── CMakeLists.txt      # or premake5.lua, Makefile, etc. for workspace-level builds
├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
├── README.md           # Workspace overview and instructions
└── LICENSE             # License file (if applicable)
```


- **`build/`**: Generated by the build system, this folder contains all build 
    output and artifacts, such as compiled binaries, object files, logs, coverage
    reports, and other files generated during the build process. This folder should
    be ignored by version control (e.g., Git) and should not contain any source files
    or manually created files.
- **`docs/`**: Contains all specifications, design documents, and other
    documentation related to the projects in this workspace.
- **`templates/`**: Contains document templates for specifications, design
    documents, and other documentation needs.
- **`projects/`**: Contains all C and C++ projects. Each project should
    have its own subdirectory with its own build configuration (e.g., CMakeLists.txt,
    premake5.lua, Makefile, etc.).
- **`vendor/`**: Contains third-party libraries and dependencies. Each library should
    have its own subdirectory with its own build configuration if necessary.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains build scripts, utility scripts, and other scripts that
    assist in the development and maintenance of the projects in this workspace.
- **`tools/`**: Contains development tools and utilities that are used in the
    development process but are not part of the projects themselves.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** (or equivalent): The root-level build configuration file
    that can include or reference the build configurations of the individual projects,
    tests, and vendor libraries.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the workspace, instructions for setting up
    the development environment, and any other relevant information for developers.
- **`LICENSE`**: Contains the license information for the workspace, if applicable.

## Project Folder Structure

Each C or C++ project within the `projects/` directory should follow a consistent
folder structure. A typical layout is as follows:

```
project/
├── include/             # Public headers (or inline in src/)
│   └── project/
│       ├── module_a.hpp
│       └── module_b.hpp
├── src/                 # Source files and private headers
│   ├── module_a.cpp
│   └── module_b.cpp
├── tests/               # Test source files (for unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
│   ├── test_module_a.cpp
│   └── test_module_b.cpp
└── CMakeLists.txt       # or premake5.lua, Makefile, etc. for project-level builds
```

- **`include/`**: Contains public header files that define the interfaces of the project. These
    headers can be included by other projects or by the source files within this project.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source files that implement the functionality of the project
    as well as any private headers that are not meant to be exposed outside of the project.
- **`tests/`**: Contains test source files for unit tests, integration tests, and other types of
    tests. These files should be organized in a way that makes it clear which tests correspond
    to which modules or components of the project.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** (or equivalent): The build configuration file for the
    project that defines how to build the source files, link against dependencies, and
    run tests.
