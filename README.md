# 2026 AI Development Template

This repository serves as a template for organizing and structuring C and C++ 
projects whose development is assisted and driven by AI tools. It provides a
clear and consistent folder structure, coding standards, a steps-driven 
development process, and guidelines for documentation and testing. The goal is
to facilitate efficient collaboration between human developers and AI tools, 
ensure code quality and maintainability, and streamline the development workflow.

Proceed to replace the contents of this README with an overview of your specific
workspace, instructions for setting up the development environment, and any other
relevant information for developers working on the projects in this workspace.

> **Disclaimer**: AI tools are meant to assist and augment human developers, not
> replace them. AI tools - even advanced ones used correctly and effectively - can,
> will, and often do make mistakes. Always thoroughly and critically review any code
> or other output generated by AI tools, and never blindly trust it. Use your own
> judgment and expertise to ensure the quality and correctness of the code and other
> output in your projects.
